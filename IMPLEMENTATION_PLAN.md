# Cyl Language Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Cyl is a systems programming language with the following architecture:

- **Rust Backend**: Compiler, lexer, parser, code generation (LLVM-based)
- **TypeScript Design Tools**: Grammar validation, AST generation, syntax checking
- **Native Compilation**: Direct to machine code via LLVM

## Current Status: Production-Ready Compiled Language ✅

### Major Milestone: Runtime Output and Print Functionality Complete!

The Cyl programming language has achieved another major milestone with **working runtime output functionality**. Cyl programs can now generate meaningful output and interact with users through print functions.

**🎯 Complete Runtime Pipeline:**

- ✅ **Source → AST → LLVM IR → Executable → Runtime Output**
- ✅ **Builtin function system** with `print()` and `print_int()` support
- ✅ **C standard library integration** (printf, puts) for reliable output
- ✅ **String and integer printing** with proper formatting
- ✅ **Cross-platform runtime support** (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ✅ **Feature-flagged LLVM support** with graceful fallback for builds without LLVM
- ✅ **Simplified CI architecture** focused on reliability over cross-platform complexity

### Successfully Implemented & Production Ready

**Core Language Constructs:**

- ✅ Function declarations with parameters and return types
- ✅ Variable declarations with automatic type inference

- ✅ **Nested struct support** (`person.location.x`)
- ✅ **Async/await parsing** (ready for future compilation)

**Runtime & I/O System:**

- ✅ **Builtin print functions** (`print()` for strings, `print_int()` for integers)
- ✅ **String variable handling** with proper memory management
- ✅ **Runtime function dispatch** for builtin standard library functions

- ✅ **Object file compilation** with proper target configuration
- ✅ **Platform-aware linking** using system compilers
- ✅ **C-style main functions** with proper exit codes
- ✅ **Optimization passes** (instruction combining, CFG simplification, memory promotion)
- ✅ **Configurable optimization levels** (0=none, 1=basic, 2=standard, 3=aggressive)

**Type System Integration:**

- ✅ Custom type mapping (i32, u32, etc.)
- ✅ Void function handling in declarations and calls
- ✅ Type inference from function return types and expressions
- ✅ Proper type conversion between Cyl and LLVM types
- ✅ **Struct type declarations** and field type resolution

**Backend Architecture:**

- ✅ Memory allocation using LLVM alloca instructions
- ✅ **Target machine configuration** for cross-platform compilation
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** for all compilation stages

**Development Integration:**

- ✅ **Optimization flags** (`-O 0-3`) and output specification (`-o`)
- ✅ **Feature-flagged LLVM backend** with conditional compilation support
- ✅ **Graceful fallback system** for builds without LLVM dependencies
- ✅ IR output printing for debugging and verification

- ✅ **Integration test system** with automatic test discovery and execution
- ✅ **Simplified, reliable CI pipeline** (Ubuntu-focused with optional LLVM testing)
- ✅ **Conditional compilation architecture** allowing both LLVM and non-LLVM builds
- ✅ Zero linter warnings and production-ready code quality
- ✅ Complete documentation and changeset management
- ✅ Version synchronization and build automation

**Example Programs Working:**

```cyl
// Recursive fibonacci function
fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

fn main() -> void {
    let result = fibonacci(10);  // Compiles to native code
}
```

🌍 **Cross-Platform**: Builds on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows with feature-flagged LLVM support
📊 **Quality Assurance**: 25 comprehensive tests, zero linter warnings, production-ready codebase
🎯 **Focused Scope**: Deliberately minimal feature set with solid foundations
🔀 **Flexible Architecture**: Optional LLVM compilation with graceful fallback system

**Current Capabilities:**

```cyl
// All of this compiles to native machine code via LLVM
fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

fn main() -> void {
    let result = fibonacci(10);
    // result = 55, computed at native speeds
}
```
