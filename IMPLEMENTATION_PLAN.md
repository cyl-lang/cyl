## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **LLVM Integration Complexity**: Start with simple IR generation, iterate
- **Memory Safety Implementation**: Study Rust's borrow checker extensively
- **Parser Complexity**: Use proven parsing library (Chumsky)
- **Type System Complexity**: Implement incrementally

### Resource Risks

- **Development Time**: Focus on MVP first, add features iteratively
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to planned phases, defer advanced features
- **Tool Compatibility**: Test across different platforms early

### Quality Risks

- **Testing Coverage**: Implement tests alongside features
- **Documentation Debt**: Document as you build
- **Performance Issues**: Profile early and often
