## Current Status: LLVM Backend Implementation ‚úÖ

### Successfully Implemented

The Cyl language now features a working LLVM-based native code generation backend that can compile and execute Cyl programs to native machine code. Key accomplishments:

**Core Language Constructs:**

- ‚úÖ Function declarations with parameters and return types
- ‚úÖ Variable declarations with automatic type inference

- ‚úÖ Comparison operations (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=)
- ‚úÖ Control flow: if/else statements and while loops
- ‚úÖ Function calls including recursive function support
- ‚úÖ Return statements with proper value handling

**Type System Integration:**

- ‚úÖ Support for i32, i64, f32, f64, bool, char types
- ‚úÖ Custom type mapping (i32, u32, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Void function handling in declarations and calls
- ‚úÖ Type inference from function return types
- ‚úÖ Proper type conversion between Cyl and LLVM types

**Backend Architecture:**

- ‚úÖ LLVM Context, Module, and Builder management
- ‚úÖ Symbol tables for variables and functions with type info
- ‚úÖ Two-pass compilation (declare functions, then compile)
- ‚úÖ Memory allocation using LLVM alloca instructions
- ‚úÖ Error handling for unsupported constructs

**Development Integration:**

- ‚úÖ CLI integration with `--llvm` flag for run/build commands
- ‚úÖ IR output printing for debugging and verification

**Example Programs Working:**

```cyl
// Recursive fibonacci function
fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

fn main() -> void {
    let result = fibonacci(10);  // Compiles to native code
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **LLVM Integration Complexity**: Start with simple IR generation, iterate
- **Memory Safety Implementation**: Study Rust's borrow checker extensively
- **Parser Complexity**: Use proven parsing library (Chumsky)
- **Type System Complexity**: Implement incrementally

### Resource Risks

- **Development Time**: Focus on MVP first, add features iteratively
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to planned phases, defer advanced features
- **Tool Compatibility**: Test across different platforms early

### Quality Risks

- **Testing Coverage**: Implement tests alongside features
- **Documentation Debt**: Document as you build
- **Performance Issues**: Profile early and often
