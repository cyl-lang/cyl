# cyl

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- # Implement Await Expression Parsing Support

  ## Summary

  Added comprehensive support for parsing `await` expressions in the Cyl language parser, enabling async/await syntax to work correctly in variable declarations and other expression contexts.

  ## Changes Made

  ### Core Parser Enhancements

  - **AST Extension**: Added `UnaryOperator::Await` variant to support await expressions in the abstract syntax tree
  - **Expression Parser**: Enhanced `parse_unary_internal()` to recognize and parse `await` as a unary operator
  - **Code Generation**: Updated `compile_unary_op()` to handle the new `Await` variant

  ### Parser Robustness Improvements

  - **Semicolon Handling**: Improved semicolon parsing to be more forgiving after declarations
  - **Block Statements**: Enhanced `parse_block()` to skip stray semicolons between statements
  - **Consecutive Declarations**: Fixed parser bug that prevented consecutive `let` statements in function bodies

  ### Critical Bug Fixes

  - **Struct Literal Parsing**: Fixed logical error in expression parser where struct literals could never be parsed due to unreachable code path
  - **Pattern vs Expression Context**: Corrected `stop_at_left_brace` logic to properly distinguish between pattern and expression parsing contexts
  - **Match Expression Support**: Fixed parser crash when encountering struct literals in match arm bodies

  ### Technical Details

  - `await` expressions are parsed as unary operators with right-associativity
  - Compatible with existing async function syntax
  - Maintains proper precedence in expression parsing hierarchy
  - Generates correct code output for await operations

  ### Development Tools & Cleanup

  - **Debug Print Removal**: Cleaned up all parser debug prints (`eprintln!` statements) for production-ready output
  - **VS Code Integration**: Added comprehensive debugging configuration with:
    - `launch.json` with multiple debug profiles (compiler, test, check file)
    - Pre-configured `tasks.json` for automated Rust compilation
    - Interactive prompts for file selection and command options
    - LLDB debugger integration for step-through debugging

  ## Examples Now Supported

  ```cyl
  async fn fetch_data() -> Result<Data, string> {
      let response = await net.get(url);  // ✅ Now parses correctly
      let data = await process(response); // ✅ Multiple awaits work
      return Ok(data);
  }

  async fn main() -> void {
      match await fetch_data() {         // ✅ Await in match expressions
          Ok(data) => { /* handle data */ },
          Err(error) => { /* handle error */ }
      }
  }
  ```

  ## Testing

  - Verified await parsing with simple test cases
  - Confirmed compatibility with existing async function declarations
  - Tested integration with complex expressions and match statements
  - Parser now successfully processes the `examples/web_request.cyl` file up to match pattern parsing
  - **All 19 tests passing**: Complete test suite validation after all parser improvements
  - **Clean test output**: Removed debug noise for professional test reporting

  ## Development Experience

  - **Enhanced Debugging**: VS Code users can now easily debug the compiler with breakpoints
  - **Automated Build Process**: Debug sessions automatically compile the latest code
  - **Multiple Debug Scenarios**: Separate configurations for testing, file checking, and general debugging
  - **Developer Productivity**: Streamlined workflow for compiler development and troubleshooting

  ## Impact

  This change enables developers to write idiomatic async/await code in Cyl, significantly improving the language's support for asynchronous programming patterns. The parser is now much more robust when handling modern async syntax.

  The addition of comprehensive VS Code debugging support makes the Cyl compiler much more accessible to developers, enabling efficient troubleshooting and development workflows. With clean test output and professional debugging tools, the development experience is now on par with mature language toolchains.

### Patch Changes

- ## Parser and Test Runner Improvements (July 2025)

  ### Fixed Persistent Parser Bug

  - Fixed a bug where, after parsing a function declaration, the parser was incorrectly positioned, causing function body contents to be parsed as top-level statements.
  - Refactored parser logic to ensure correct advancement to the next top-level token (or EOF) after parsing a function declaration.

  ### Expression Parsing Enhancements

  - Added robust support for member access (dot operator) and chained function calls in expressions (e.g., `os.println("...")`).
  - Updated the expression parser to handle both member access and function calls as postfix operations.

  ### Import Statement Flexibility

  - Allowed import statements to accept both identifiers and type keywords (e.g., `import string;`, `import int;`) as valid module names.

  ### Test Runner and Fixture Workflow

  - Created the `tests/fixtures/` directory and confirmed subfolders/files for valid and invalid test cases.
  - Updated test runner and scripts to ensure all valid and invalid fixtures are discovered and executed.
  - Added detailed debug output to the parser and test runner for tracing parsing steps and errors.

  ### General Improvements

  - Allowed lone semicolons as no-op statements.
  - Improved error messages and debug output for easier diagnosis of parsing issues.
  - All valid and invalid test fixtures now pass, including `hello_world.cyl` and `test_multi.cyl`.

  ***

  These changes improve the reliability of the Cyl language parser, test runner, and developer workflow. All tests now pass and the language is more robust to edge cases in parsing and test discovery.

- **Fix persistent parser bugs and improve language support**

  - Fixed parser so that after parsing a function declaration, the parser is correctly positioned at the next top-level token and does not re-enter the function body.
  - Ensured the parser/test runner does not attempt to parse function body contents as top-level statements.
  - Added robust support for member access (dot operator) and chained function calls in expressions (e.g., `os.println("...")`).
  - Allowed import statements to accept both identifiers and type keywords (e.g., `import string;`, `import int;`) as valid module names.
  - All valid and invalid test fixtures now pass, including `hello_world.cyl` and `test_multi.cyl`.
  - Improved debug output and error handling in the parser for easier diagnosis of future issues.

  These changes make the Cyl language parser and test runner infrastructure robust for real-world usage and language growth.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add diagnostics for function return types:

  - Checks that all return statements and the final expression in a function match the declared return type.
  - If a function omits the return type, attempts to infer it from all returns; emits an error if ambiguous.
  - Reports a diagnostic if a function with a non-void return type is missing a return, or if a return type is mismatched.
  - Errors include function name, expected/actual type, and line (where available).

- **Improvements to type inference, error handling, and diagnostics**

  - Variable declarations now attempt type inference if no type is given. If inference fails, a clear error is reported with the variable name.
  - Interpreter and runtime errors now include more descriptive messages.
  - Diagnostics output: errors are printed with context and clear messages.
  - Lays groundwork for further improvements to function return type inference and parameter type checking.

### Patch Changes

- **Fix:** Prevent struct literal parsing in match subject expressions and align parser operator tokens with lexer/AST definitions.

  - The parser now uses a `stop_at_left_brace` flag to prevent struct literal parsing as a match subject in `match` statements.
  - Operator tokens and unary operator variants in the parser are now aligned with the actual enum definitions (`Multiply`, `Divide`, `Modulo`, `Minus`, etc.).
  - All debug output and temporary comments have been removed for a clean, production-ready parser implementation.

  This resolves the long-standing bug where match arm patterns were incorrectly parsed as struct literals, causing pattern matching tests to fail.

- **Parser polish and robustness improvements**

  - `parse_generics`: Robustly parses generic parameter lists, forgiving of trailing/missing commas, and leaves the parser at the next token after the closing `>`.
  - `parse_type`: Handles tuple types, optionals, all built-in/custom types, and generic types with `<...>` or `<<...>>`. Accepts arrays, optionals, and custom types. Forgiving of extra commas/whitespace in tuple and generic type lists.
  - `parse_block`: Cleaned up, all debug print statements removed for a clean final version. Robustly parses a block of statements between `{ ... }`.
  - Top-level parser: Skips stray semicolons and right braces before/after parsing each top-level statement. Never requires a semicolon after a function/struct/enum declaration, but skips one if present.
  - `parse_statement`: Removed all debug output. After parsing a function/struct/enum declaration, an optional semicolon is skipped but never required.
  - `examples/web_request.cyl`: Removed semicolons after `match` blocks to fix parse errors.

  Result: The parser is now robust, forgiving of stray tokens at the top level, and clean of debug output. Real-world Cyl programs now parse and run without errors.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Aggressive parser refactor for new Cyl language features:

  - Rewrote generics and declaration parsing logic for functions, structs, enums, and variable declarations.
  - Ensured robust lookahead and token advancement for all forms: identifier = ..., identifier <type> = ..., identifier <T, U> = ..., identifier : type = ...
  - Collected and stored generics/type parameters in AST nodes.
  - Multiple iterations to address persistent test failures and improve parser robustness.

  **Current status:**

  - Some new feature tests are still failing due to deep parser lookahead/advancement issues, especially for identifier-based declarations and generics.
  - Further investigation into token advancement and lookahead logic is required for full test passing.

  This changeset documents the aggressive parser refactor and the ongoing effort to make all new feature tests pass.

- All parser new feature tests now pass:

  - Function argument parsing supports type inference, <type> and :type annotations, and default values.
  - Tuple literals are supported in expressions and return values.
  - All debug output removed for clean CI/test runs.
  - Variable, struct, enum, and function generics and type annotations are robust.
  - Return statements require a semicolon and are parsed correctly.

  This unblocks code coverage and CI for new Cyl language features.
