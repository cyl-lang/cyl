# cyl

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Aggressive parser refactor for new Cyl language features:

  - Rewrote generics and declaration parsing logic for functions, structs, enums, and variable declarations.
  - Ensured robust lookahead and token advancement for all forms: identifier = ..., identifier <type> = ..., identifier <T, U> = ..., identifier : type = ...
  - Collected and stored generics/type parameters in AST nodes.
  - Multiple iterations to address persistent test failures and improve parser robustness.

  **Current status:**

  - Some new feature tests are still failing due to deep parser lookahead/advancement issues, especially for identifier-based declarations and generics.
  - Further investigation into token advancement and lookahead logic is required for full test passing.

  This changeset documents the aggressive parser refactor and the ongoing effort to make all new feature tests pass.

- All parser new feature tests now pass:

  - Function argument parsing supports type inference, <type> and :type annotations, and default values.
  - Tuple literals are supported in expressions and return values.
  - All debug output removed for clean CI/test runs.
  - Variable, struct, enum, and function generics and type annotations are robust.
  - Return statements require a semicolon and are parsed correctly.

  This unblocks code coverage and CI for new Cyl language features.
