Fix clippy uninlined_format_args warnings for CI compliance

Resolved clippy `uninlined_format_args` lint warnings that were causing CI failures:
- Updated `format!("{:?}", t)` to `format!("{t:?}")` in helpers.rs
- Updated `format!("...: {:?}", other)` to `format!("...: {other:?}")` in statements.rs
- Improves code readability by using inline format arguments
- Follows modern Rust formatting best practices
- All clippy lints now pass with `-D warnings` flag
- Maintains 100% test coverage and functionality

This ensures the project follows the latest Rust linting standards and eliminates CI failures.
