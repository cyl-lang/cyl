- Fixed the code coverage workflow.
  > #### Notes
  >
  > - The coverage report is still not covering the Rust compiler. This is due to issues with the `cargo-tarpaulin` tool, which will be addressed in a future update.
  > - The only coverage reported is for the TypeScript/Design code.
- Updated the documentation patch to include the latest changes.
  - Altered the coverage page to reflect the current state of the code coverage.
