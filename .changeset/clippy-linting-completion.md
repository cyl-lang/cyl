Complete clippy linting fixes for CI compliance

Resolved all remaining clippy warnings to ensure CI passes cleanly:
- Replaced single-pattern `match` statements with `if let` for better style
- Changed `.get(0)` calls to `.first()` for improved readability
- Added `#[allow(clippy::only_used_in_recursion)]` for methods where `self` is only used in recursive calls
- All clippy warnings now pass with `-D warnings` flag
- Maintained 100% test coverage (Rust: 5/5 tests, TypeScript: 20/20 tests)

This ensures the project follows Rust best practices and will pass CI builds without linting errors.
